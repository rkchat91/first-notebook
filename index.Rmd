# 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility \
Monya Baker\
25 May 2016\

## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research\
**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments,** and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature's* survery of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.\
\
The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitude towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveryed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is proabably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature. \

# The Survey 

In the survey [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

[^1]:The survey can be downloaded [here](https://www.nature.com/news/polopoly_fs/7.36741!/file/Reproduciblility%20Questionnaire.doc)

* Better understanding of statistics
* Better mentoring/supervision
* More robust design
* Better teaching
* More within-lab validation
* Incentives for better practice
* Incentives for formal reproduction
* More external-lab validation
* More time for mentoring
* Journals enforcing standards
* More time checking notebooks
